# MongoDB Atlas Search Review

This is a review of MongoDB Atlas Search.

## What is MongoDB Atlas Search?

MongoDB Atlas Search is a way to search text quickly. The search relies on a pre-existing "MongoDB Atlas Search Index" (a pre-built index that allows MongoDB to retrieve the required results more quickly).

## After This Tutorial, You Will Be Able To:
1. Understand what a search index is.
2. Know what MongoDB Atlas Search is and its capabilities.
3. Analyze the effectiveness of a query.
4. Easily connect to MongoDB and run all desired queries without the limitations of the driver.

## Contents:
This exploration contains 3 parts:
1. **Example of the Efficiency of Indexing**: Analyzing how indexing improves query performance.
2. **Capabilities of Indexing a Textual Field**: Demonstrating the powerful features of MongoDB Atlas Search.
3. **Connecting to MongoDB through HTTP**: Instructions on how to connect to MongoDB via HTTP and run queries.
